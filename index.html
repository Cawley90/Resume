			<h2 class="lihead" a id="intro">Introduction</h2>
			<p>James Rhaymes is an accomplished dog trainer operating in Bellevue, Washington. He has trained ~60 dogs to do basic obedience behaviors, as well as helping some of those dogs get over their anxiety issues. Equipped with the tools of positive-based training methods, he ensures that every one of his students are having fun and making progress appropriately! In his experience, he has only had to refer 6 of his dogs to another professional due to confidence issues with said dogs. Along with keeping the environment positive, ensuring all the dogs in his classes are safe is a top priority. Along with keeping the classes fun for his dogs, keeping it fun and interactive for each dog's respective owner is achieved by a lot of fun games that promote a time designated for dog owners to engage in an activity with their canine companions. Something humans and dogs share in common is they both thrive on projects, so integrating that into the class is a key component in its success.</p>

			<p>This basic outline covers a 6+ week course designed to cover some of the more desired behaviors. While the general timeframe is six weeks, it can be extended based on each dog owner's needs, and the actual course cirriculum is subject to change based-again-on each dog owner's needs. The classes can either be paid for in a lump sum of $120, or $15 dollars for a one day class focusing one only one behavior. In addition to this, we host puppy socialization programs once a week. This structure has proven to be very effective, and would love to carry it over with me should I be accepted.</p>
